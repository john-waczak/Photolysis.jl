Due to very uncertain vapor pressure data there is a large uncertainty in the absorption coefficients. We have chosen to simply average the reported vapor pressures to obtain our absorption values.""",142.3,"biphenyl, phenylbenzene", https://doi.org/10.1016/0301-0104(78)87021-9,(C6H5)2,298.0,"data/cross-sections/Aromatic compounds/Benzene, biphenyl/(C6H5)2/(C6H5)2_McLaughlinClark(1978)_298K_142.csv"
